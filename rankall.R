## `rankall` takes two arguments: an outcome name (`outcome`) and a hospital ranking
## (`num`). The function reads the outcome-of-care-measures.csv file and returns
## a 2-column data frame containing the hospital in each state that has the 
## ranking specified in num. For example the function call 
## rankall("heart attack", "best") would return a data frame containing the 
## names of the hospitals that are the best in their respective states for 
## 30-day heart attack death rates. The function should return a value for every
## state (some may be NA). The first column in the data frame is named hospital,
## which contains the hospital name, and the second column is named state, which
## contains the 2-character abbreviation for the state name. Hospitals that do
## not have data on a particular outcome should be excluded from the set of 
## hospitals when deciding the rankings.

rankall <- function(outcome, num = "best") {
  ## Read outcome data
  ## Check that state and outcome are valid
  ## For each state, find the hospital of the given rank
  ## Return a data frame with the hospital names and the
  ## (abbreviated) state name
}
